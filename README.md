# Overview

Node.js-based backend for an e-commerce website that returns a list of products, prices, reviews, countinstock, and allows for uploading product photos. This project uses Express.js for handling requests, MongoDB for database storage, and Amazon S3 for file storage. It includes API endpoints for interacting with the database and integrates with a file storage service to handle the uploading and retrieval of product photos. Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented to ensure the security of the backend.
